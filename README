## Part of the analysis code for the study: Beam Energy Dependence of net $\Lambda$ Fluctuations Measured by the Experiment at RHIC

This set of codes calculates the efficiency corrected cumulants for a event by event fluctuation analysis.
Efficiency correction is done by taking the momentum dependency of the reconstruction efficiency in to account as explained
in the  paper: arXiv:1702.07106v3 [physics.data-an] 10 Jun 2017 by T.Nonaka et al.

**So, if you need any help in using these codes please feel free to email**

Note: Input file should contain the <q(r,s)> TProfile histograms as the input for these set of codes to generate the output.
