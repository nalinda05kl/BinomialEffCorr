This set of codes calculates the efficiency corrected cumulants for a event by event fluctuation analysis.
Efficiency correction is done by taking the momentum dependency of the reconstruction efficiency as explained
in the  paper: arXiv:1702.07106v3 [physics.data-an] 10 Jun 2017 by T.Nonaka et al.

This readme file is still not completed. So, if you need any help in using these codes plese fell free to email me.
